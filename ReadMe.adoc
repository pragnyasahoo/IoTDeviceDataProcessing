== Introduction
The requirements are below.

== Description: 
A company needs a solution to process data from millions of IoT devices in realtime. The data needs to be ingested, processed, and stored for further analysis. The
solution should be built using .NET 8 and Azure Cloud Services. 

== Requirements
1. Data Ingestion: Use Azure IoT Hub to ingest data from IoT devices.
2. Stream Processing: Implement real-time data processing using Azure
Services
3. Data Storage: Store processed data in Azure & SQL Database.
4. API: Create a web application using ASP.NET Core to visualize real-time data
and historical trends.
5. Web Application: Create a web application using ASP.NET Core and
Consume API to visualize real-time data and historical trends.
6. Security: Implement security measures to ensure data integrity and
confidentiality.
7. Scalability: Ensure the solution can scale to handle data from an increasing
number of devices.
8. Alerting: Set up alerting for specific conditions using Azure Monitor

== Deliverables
[square]
* Architecture diagram 
* API Design (at least one) 
* Source code repository with documented code and share with us GitHub link
for the review
* Deployment Mode
* Short presentation meeting (in-person or online meeting) explaining the solution. 
 

== Code Description
 * This code follows the clean code architecture. There are below projects are there as per the clean code.

1.	IoTDataProcessing.Api
2.	IoTDataProcessing.Application
3.	IoTDataProcessing.Domain
4.	IoTDataProcessing.Infrastructure

* The code follows the CQR, MediatR, Solid principle and repository Pattern.
This is code first approve. The below command create the script file for DB


== Create the migration
[source]
----
cd .\IoTDataProcessing.Infrastructure
dotnet ef migrations add <migration-Name> --project ../IoTDataProcessing.Infrastructure --startup-project ../IoTDataProcessing.Api

----


Update the database directly

[source]
----
dotnet ef database update --project ../IoTDataProcessing.Infrastructure --startup-project ../IoTDataProcessing.Api
----

Create the sql script

[source]
----
dotnet ef migrations script --output <DbName.sql> --project ../IoTDataProcessing.Infrastructure --startup-project ../IoTDataProcessing.Api
----

Remove the latest migration
[source]
----
Remove the migration
dotnet ef migrations remove --project ../IoTDataProcessing.Infrastructure --startup-project ../IoTDataProcessing.Api
